Linear transformation: after a linear transformation, lines remain lines, and the origin stays fixed. In other words, keep grid lines parallel and evenly spaced.

"Composition" of multiple transformations `A @ B @ P`:

- Matrix multiplication of those individual transformation matrices
- The transformation of the rightward matrix `B` get applied first

Again, 3D transformation matrix's columns: new locations of the new unit vectors.
